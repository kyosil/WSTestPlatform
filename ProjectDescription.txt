This project goal is to replicate the trading card game "Weiss Schwarz" into a digital game to be played between two players.

Initial goal is to have all action to be done manually.
Late goal to automate certain actions if possible.


Currently the project functions are:
- Host a game locally
- Join a local game
- Draw a hand of cards
- Drag and drop cards

Sorting the data from a website after obtaining the card info and creating a list of card objects with the sorted data
